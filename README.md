# burgeration 

Burgeration is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

It's a simple page like app, where most of the action happen in the same page.

It's been done by using Node & its package friends:

###MySQL,
###Express,
###Handlebars
###Bulma
for styling
and a homemade ORM as a secret ingredient! (yum!).

#How does it work?
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
